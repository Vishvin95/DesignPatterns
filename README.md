# Design Patterns
The purpose of this repository is to implement and get clear examples of various design patterns being used. Design patterns help us to follow SOLID principles of Object Oriented programming. Thus, helping us make reusable components, making code maintainable in form of extensions with minimal changes and hence make an efficient code base for our applications.

# How design patterns help us?
1. They help us communicating the language of object oriented programming well with other developers.
2. With a design pattern, we use less words to communicate more.
3. They are not just code reuse, but an experience reuse for the problems which people have already faced while developing applications.

# How to learn them?
1. No need to learn them.
2. Learn the principles which lead to derivation of certain pattern.
3. Given a problem on hand, try to come up with a basic skeleton and start questioning it, whether it is open for extension, whether the logic will be reusable in other places, if required in future, can I change the runtime behavior of my objects, etc. If you understand these principles well, you will definitely understand, how to remove things and make it less prone to change in future.
4. The basic tools are the only 5 object oriented principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Overloading, Inheritance and Overriding.
